The regular captain's warnings landed on deaf ears:

He had warned about the ship's decrease in stability.

The ferry company threatened to fire him if he continued his objections. 

He relayed his warnings through an official working for the Incheon Port Authority on 9 April 2014, which an official from Chonghaejin responded to by stating that "he would deal with anyone making the claims". 

He also requested a repair for the malfunctioning steering gear on 1 April 2014, but this was not done.

The Sewol was **grossly** overloaded with 2142 tons of cargo of the recommended 987 tons of cargo.
It was also carrying merely 761 tons water ballast of the recommended 2030 tons.

Two turns that were executed too fast caused the ship to take on water and tilt.

> In one of their more damning findings, prosecutors say that so much money was being siphoned away from the ferry company to Mr. Yoo and his relatives that it was starved of funds and spent just $2 last year on safety training for the Sewol’s crew members. The money went to buy a paper copy of a certificate.

> During the accident, the chaos caused by the lack of training was clear. Some crew members readily admitted in interviews after the disaster that they had no idea what to do during the emergency, had never done evacuation drills and made fatal mistakes like repeatedly telling passengers over the intercom to “stay inside and wait” as the ship began to sink, dragging scores of students down with it.

Yoo Byung-eun is a piece of shit.
