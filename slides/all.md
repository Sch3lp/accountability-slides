It is impossible to confirm whether or not they wore (life jackets). Crew members are at the bridge and are unable to move. Please hurry.

> Roger that. How is the flooded situation?
> It cannot be confirmed either. We confirmed that several containers on the deck fell, but because we cannot move, we cannot move even by one step from the bridge, we are able to stand by holding on to the wall.

10:25 - Call between Coast Guard and President's Office

> Where is the commissioner?
> He is in the meeting room of the Crisis Management Division.
> In a meeting? Okay. Here's a message from the President. Pass it on to him immediately.

|>

> First, make sure to have no casualties.
> Secondly, make sure no one is missing in the ferry by scouring the cabins and engine room.
> These are the two orders from the President and send the memo to the commissioner.

|>

10:28 - Call between Coast Guard HQ and West Coast Guard

> In my opinion, we need someone to get on the ferry and make a decision to evacuate the passengers in an orderly fashion. People should be able to move to the deck and jump off the ship. So any rescuer who goes down first in the dangerous situation will be a hero later.

|>

10:35 - Call between Air Rescue Service and West Coast Guard

> Can't our Air Rescue Service agent land on the ferry?
> Only the tip of the bow remains above the water, and I don't think it's possible.
> We should have landed on the ship earlier and made a good scene. It is a shame.
> We should have shown our agents evacuating the passengers.
> So most of the passengers are out then?

> Yes, they are.

> So no passenger is left in the ferry?
> Yes people escaped as the ship started to tilt. We didn't search the cabins, but it seems most people got out.
> So we can presume there is almost no one in the ferry then?
> Yes, yes.

|>

18:35 - The President had spent most of her morning in bed and is still not up to date.

> I think we have to verify if the passengers are alive or not before sunset. How difficult is it to find the students in their lifejackets?
... long pause
> Lifejackets are not helpful to find them because they are locked inside of the ship.
> They are locked in.. I see..

|>

The day after: 291 of 476 people still trapped. The day passes.

|>

17th of April 2014, if there was still air trapped in the ship, there is a possibility that there could still be some survivors.

Civilian divers are eager to help in any way possible, many are preparing themselves to dive at midnight.

But they're being told by the government that they had to pump air in the ferry now, since the President is watching.

|>

A civilian diver narrates:

> ...I checked their diving equipment and it was so decrepit and could stop cold at any moment. I said, this could kill you first before you save the kids. But they said that they had to pretend to do it at least because the President was watching.

In less than 3 minutes, the compressor and radio went off and the government diver was signaled to come up.

Upon resurfacing he claimed that he had successfully installed the air hose.
He should have searched first for the spot where the air was trapped, if any.

But he just attached the air hose somewhere underwater, outside of the ship.

> They had to report a successful operation to the President, so they staged it. The remaining part of the ferry started to sink as they pumped air into the sea.

The ship sank completely before next morning.

|>

Captain defending his decision to tell people to stay put

> The current was very high and the water was cold. Even if you got off the boat you would've been swept very far away even if you had worn a life jacket.

> Expected time before exhaustion or unconsciousness at water temperatures 10–15.6° Celsius: 1-2 hours, survival time: 1-6 hours

Captain wasn't on the bridge when the boat began to sink. Was in his bedroom.

Third mate was at the helm and made the mistake of not slowing down and making a turn excessively.

Captain still held accountable for failing to slow down in the narrow route and making the turn excessively.

|>

The 69-year-old captain that was commanding the ship during the disaster was brought in as a temporary replacement.

Of the 33-man crew, 19 were irregular part-time workers.

|>

The regular captain's warnings landed on deaf ears:

He had warned about the ship's decrease in stability.

The ferry company threatened to fire him if he continued his objections. 

He relayed his warnings through an official working for the Incheon Port Authority on 9 April 2014, which an official from Chonghaejin responded to by stating that "he would deal with anyone making the claims". 

He also requested a repair for the malfunctioning steering gear on 1 April 2014, but this was not done.

|>

The Sewol was **grossly** overloaded with 2142 tons of cargo of the recommended 987 tons of cargo.
It was also carrying merely 761 tons water ballast of the recommended 2030 tons.

Two turns that were executed too fast caused the ship to take on water and tilt.

|>

> In one of their more damning findings, prosecutors say that so much money was being siphoned away from the ferry company to Mr. Yoo and his relatives that it was starved of funds and spent just $2 last year on safety training for the Sewol’s crew members. The money went to buy a paper copy of a certificate.

> During the accident, the chaos caused by the lack of training was clear. Some crew members readily admitted in interviews after the disaster that they had no idea what to do during the emergency, had never done evacuation drills and made fatal mistakes like repeatedly telling passengers over the intercom to “stay inside and wait” as the ship began to sink, dragging scores of students down with it.

Yoo Byung-eun is a piece of shit.

|>

> Of the 476 on board, 172 were rescued. Of the 325 students, only 75 survived, and only 3 of the 14 teachers. However, of 33 crew members, 22 were rescued.
