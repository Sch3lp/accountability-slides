> 119 Situation room.
> Help me. The ship seems to be sinking.
> A ship is sinking?
> We are on the way to Jeju island, and the ferry tilted to one side.
> Hold on. Is this the ship you are on or a ship next to you?
> The ship I am on board.
> What is the location of the ship?
> I don't know the location.
> You don't know? Don't you have the longitude and latitude on the GPS? What's the name of the ship?
> Sewol, it is the Sewol.

|>

On the night of April 15th 2014, the _Sewol_ ferry departed Incheon port, South Korea.

|>

**476** passengers are on board, of which **325 students** on a school trip to Jeju island.

|>

08:55 - Initial call between _Sewol_ and _Jeju Vessel Traffic Service Center_

> Jindo Vessel Traffic Service, this is the Sewol ferry.
> Sewol ferry, this is Jindo Vessel Traffic Service, what is the situation with you there?
> All of us are off our feet now. I don't know whether I should order everyone to jump into the water or not.
> I told the crewmen to wear their lifejacket and be on standby.
> The crewmen are here on the bridge of the ship but cannot move.

|>

9:17 
> Sewol, this is Jindo VTS, do you copy? How is the flooded condition?
> It is listed more than 50 degrees to the port side and people are not able to move from left to right. We've alerted the crew members to wear life jacket and wait. It is impossible to confirm whether or not they wore (life jackets). Crew members are at the bridge and are unable to move. Please hurry.

> Roger that. How is the flooded situation?
> It cannot be confirmed either. We confirmed that several containers on the deck fell, but because we cannot move, we cannot move even by one step from the bridge, we are able to stand by holding on to the wall.

|>

9:23 
> Patrol boat ETA is 15 minutes. Please broadcast and tell the passengers to wear life jackets.
> We are unable to broadcast.

|>

> At this moment the ship is tilted and sinking.
> Is there any live video feed yet?
> Not yet.

|>

09:25 - _Jindo Vessel Traffic Service_ to _Sewol_

> This is Sewol. Do you copy?

10:25 - Call between Coast Guard and President's Office

> Where is the commissioner?
> He is in the meeting room of the Crisis Management Division.
> In a meeting? Okay. Here's a message from the President. Pass it on to him immediately.

|>

> First, make sure to have no casualties.
> Secondly, make sure no one is missing in the ferry by scouring the cabins and engine room.
> These are the two orders from the President and send the memo to the commissioner.

|>

10:28 - Call between Coast Guard HQ and West Coast Guard

> In my opinion, we need someone to get on the ferry and make a decision to evacuate the passengers in an orderly fashion. People should be able to move to the deck and jump off the ship. So any rescuer who goes down first in the dangerous situation will be a hero later.

|>

10:35 - Call between Air Rescue Service and West Coast Guard

> Can't our Air Rescue Service agent land on the ferry?
> Only the tip of the bow remains above the water, and I don't think it's possible.
> We should have landed on the ship earlier and made a good scene. It is a shame.
> We should have shown our agents evacuating the passengers.
> So most of the passengers are out then?

> Yes, they are.

> So no passenger is left in the ferry?
> Yes people escaped as the ship started to tilt. We didn't search the cabins, but it seems most people got out.
> So we can presume there is almost no one in the ferry then?
> Yes, yes.

|>

18:35 - The President had spent most of her morning in bed and is still not up to date.

> I think we have to verify if the passengers are alive or not before sunset. How difficult is it to find the students in their lifejackets?
... long pause
> Lifejackets are not helpful to find them because they are locked inside of the ship.
> They are locked in.. I see..

|>

The day after: 291 of 476 people still trapped. The day passes.

|>

17th of April 2014, if there was still air trapped in the ship, there is a possibility that there could still be some survivors.

Civilian divers are eager to help in any way possible, many are preparing themselves to dive at midnight.

But they're being told by the government that they had to pump air in the ferry now, since the President is watching.

|>

A civilian diver narrates:

> ...I checked their diving equipment and it was so decrepit and could stop cold at any moment. I said, this could kill you first before you save the kids. But they said that they had to pretend to do it at least because the President was watching.

In less than 3 minutes, the compressor and radio went off and the government diver was signaled to come up.

Upon resurfacing he claimed that he had successfully installed the air hose.
He should have searched first for the spot where the air was trapped, if any.

But he just attached the air hose somewhere underwater, outside of the ship.

> They had to report a successful operation to the President, so they staged it. The remaining part of the ferry started to sink as they pumped air into the sea.

The ship sank completely before next morning.

|>

Captain defending his decision to tell people to stay put

> The current was very high and the water was cold. Even if you got off the boat you would've been swept very far away even if you had worn a life jacket.

Captain wasn't on the bridge when the boat began to sink. Was in his bedroom.

Third mate was at the helm and made the mistake of not slowing down and making a turn excessively.

Captain still held responsible for failing to slow down in the narrow route and making the turn excessively.
