JVTS : Sewol ferry, this is Jindo Vessel Traffic Service.
JVTS : What is the situation with you there?
Sewol: All of us are off our feet now. I don't know whether I
       should order everyone to jump into the water or not.
Sewol: I told the crewmen to wear their lifejacket
       and be on standby.
Sewol: The crewmen are here on the bridge of the ship
       but cannot move.

       and people are not able to move from left to right. 
Sewol: We've alerted the crew members to wear life jacket 
       and wait. 
Sewol: It is impossible to confirm whether or not they did. 
Sewol: Crew members are at the bridge and are unable to move. 
Sewol: Please hurry.

```text
JVTS : How is the flooded situation?
Sewol: It cannot be confirmed either. 
Sewol: We confirmed that several containers on the deck fell, 
       but because we cannot move...
Sewol: ...we cannot move even by one step from the bridge.
Sewol: We are able to stand by holding on to the wall.

`10:17` - 1 hour and 28 minutes after the ship initially started sinking

Passengers are starting to get rescued.

`10:18`

Fishing boats in the vicinity are ordered to stay back over megaphone.

Notes:

Patrol Boat 123, still the only Coast Guard lifeboat present

Only approach the Sewol once, then hang back until the ferry sinks.

|>

At this point a bunch of students are swept away and fishing boats rush in to try and help them escape.

PO: Where is the commissioner?
CG: He is in the meeting room of Crisis Management.
PO: In a meeting? Okay. Here's a message from the President. 
PO: Pass it on to him immediately.
```

```text
PO: First, make sure to have no casualties.
PO: Secondly, make sure no one is missing in the ferry 
    by scouring the cabins and engine room.
PO: These are the two orders from the President 
    and send the memo to the commissioner.
```

`10:28` - _Coast Guard HQ_ - _West Coast Guard_

```text
CG: In my opinion, we need someone to get on the ferry 
    and make a decision to evacuate the passengers 
    in an orderly fashion. 
CG: People should be able to move to the deck 
    and jump off the ship. 
CG: So any rescuer who goes down first in the dangerous 
    situation will be a hero later.
```

`10:35` - _Air Rescue Service_ - _West Coast Guard_

```text
CG : Can't our Air Rescue Service agent land on the ferry?
AIR: Only the tip of the bow remains above the water, 
     and I don't think it's possible.
AIR: We should have landed on the ship earlier 
     and made a good scene. It is a shame.
AIR: We should have shown our agents evacuating the passengers.
```

`10:35` - _Air Rescue Service_ - _West Coast Guard_

```text
CG : So most of the passengers are out then?
AIR: Yes, they are.
CG : So no passenger is left in the ferry?
AIR: Yes people escaped as the ship started to tilt. 
     We didn't search the cabins, but it seems 
     most people got out.
CG : So we can presume there is almost no one 
     in the ferry then?
AIR: Yes, yes.
```

`18:35` - _President_ - _Minister_

```text
P: I think we have to verify if the passengers
   are alive or not, before sunset. 
P: How difficult is it to find the students 
   in their lifejackets?

... long pause

M: Lifejackets are not helpful to find them 
   because they are locked inside of the ship.
P: They are locked in... I see...
```

Notes:

The President had spent most of her morning in bed and is still not up to date.

In a report meeting with reporters present

|>

`17th of April 2014`

291 of 476 people still trapped

Notes:

If there was still air trapped in the ship, possibility of some survivors.

Civilian divers eager to help.

Many prepare to dive at midnight.

But they're being told by the government that they had to pump air in the ferry now, since the President is watching.

|>

A civilian diver narrates:

```text
...I checked their diving equipment and it was so decrepit 
and could stop cold at any moment. 
I said, this could kill you first before you save the kids. 
But they said that they had to pretend to do it at least 
because the President was watching...
```

Notes:

In less than 3 minutes, the compressor and radio went off and the government diver was signaled to come up.

Upon resurfacing he claimed that he had successfully installed the air hose.

He should have searched first for the spot where the air was trapped, if any.

But he just attached the air hose somewhere underwater, outside of the ship.

|>

Diver continues:

```text
They had to report a successful operation to the President,
so they staged it. 
The remaining part of the ferry started to sink 
as they pumped air into the sea.
```

|>

The ship sank completely before next morning.

|>

Of the **476** on board, 

**172** were rescued. 

Of the **325** students, 

only **75** survived.

Only **3** of the **14** teachers survived.

However, of **33** crew members, 

**22** were rescued.
